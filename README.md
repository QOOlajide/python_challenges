# 🐍 Python Challenges

This repository is a collection of Python coding problems that I’ve worked through to sharpen my skills in:

- 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- 💻 LeetCode-style problem solving
- 🧪 Core Python syntax & logic building

## 🧩 Why This Exists

As I work toward becoming a stronger software engineer and machine learning practitioner, I want to keep my Python skills sharp through continuous, hands-on problem-solving. This repo serves as my personal lab — a space for experimentation, reflection, and improvement.

## ⚙️ My Approach (UPI Method)

Each challenge is solved using the **UPI Method**:

1. **Understand** – I break down what the problem is asking and explore potential edge cases.
2. **Plan** – I sketch out a clear, step-by-step strategy before coding.
3. **Implement** – I translate the plan into clean, well-commented Python code.

I also annotate each solution with:
- My **thought process**
- Occasionally commented-out **test cases**
- Special attention to **edge cases** and Pythonic patterns

This method helps me think like an engineer, not just a coder.
